summary: Vendor-agnostic way to receive, process and export telemetry data.
description: |
  The OpenTelemetry Collector offers a vendor-agnostic implementation on how to receive,
  process and export telemetry data. In addition, it removes the need to run, operate and
  maintain multiple agents/collectors in order to support open-source telemetry data formats
  (e.g. Jaeger, Prometheus, etc.) to multiple open-source or commercial back-ends.

      `juju-info` provides basic compatibility with all charms.
      If all you want is /var/log logs and node_exporter metrics,
      this relation will be enough.
