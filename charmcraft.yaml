summary: Vendor-agnostic way to receive, process and export telemetry data.
description: |
  The OpenTelemetry Collector offers a vendor-agnostic implementation on how to receive,
  process and export telemetry data. In addition, it removes the need to run, operate and
  maintain multiple agents/collectors in order to support open-source telemetry data formats
  (e.g. Jaeger, Prometheus, etc.) to multiple open-source or commercial back-ends.

      `juju-info` provides basic compatibility with all charms.
      If all you want is /var/log logs and node_exporter metrics,
      this relation will be enough.

  cos-agent:
    description: |
      `cos-agent` is a dedicated relation for the grafana agent machine
      charm. It will allow you to set up custom scrape jobs, fetch files
      from arbitrary locations, send alert rules, dashboards, etc.
    interface: cos_agent

  receive-ca-cert:
    interface: certificate_transfer
    optional: true
    description: |
      For otelcol to create a trusted (TLS) connection with servers
      it scrapes, pushes to, etc., it needs to trust the CA that signed
      the server it talks to. CA certs forwarded over this relation are
      installed in the root CA store.
  cloud-config:
    interface: grafana_cloud_config
    optional: true

    description: Forward telemetry to another Observability stack (Grafana Cloud, COS, etc.).
  receive-server-cert:
    interface: tls-certificates
    optional: true
    limit: 1
    description: |
      Obtain a certificate from a CA.
      The charm sends a CSR over this relation and receives a signed certificate back.
      That is the cert that would be presented to incoming TLS connections.

    processors:
      type: string
      description: |
        A global opentelemetry-collector "processors" config in YAML format, without the
        "processors:" top-level key. For example, to represent a "processors" section
        such as:
        
            processors:
              batch:
              memory_limiter:
                limit_mib: 4000

        you could use `juju config otelcol processors=@processors.yaml`, with:

            # processors.yaml
            batch:
            memory_limiter:
              limit_mib: 4000

        The provided processors section will be applied to all relevant pipelines.

        requests to servers, e.g. the prometheus receiver scraping metrics endpoints.
